# Comprehensive Notes on Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python

## Introduction to Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are a powerful tool for pattern matching within text. They are a mini-language specifically designed for describing text patterns and are used for a wide variety of tasks, including:

* **Searching:** Finding specific patterns within a larger body of text.
* **Matching:** Checking if a string conforms to a particular pattern.
* **Replacing:** Substituting parts of a string that match a pattern with something else.
* **Validating:** Verifying if input data (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers) are in the correct format.
* **Extracting:** Pulling specific information out of a text string.


## I. Building Blocks of Regex

Regex patterns are constructed using a combination of literal characters and special metacharacters.

### 1. Literal Characters

These are the simplest components of a regex. They match themselves exactly.

*Examples:*  `a`, `B`, `1`, ` `, `#`, `!`, `hello`, `Chandra`


### 2. Metacharacters

These characters have special meanings within regex patterns and are crucial for creating flexible and powerful search patterns.

* **`.` (Dot):** Matches any single character (except newline).  `c.t` matches "cat", "cbt", "c#t".

* **`^` (Caret):** Matches the beginning of a string. `^Hello` matches "Hello world" but not "World Hello".

* **`$` (Dollar):** Matches the end of a string. `world$` matches "Hello world" but not "world Hello".

* **`*` (Asterisk):** Matches the preceding element zero or more times. `ab*c` matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbc".

* **`+` (Plus):** Matches the preceding element one or more times. `ab+c` matches "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", but not "ac".

* **`?` (Question Mark):** Matches the preceding element zero or one time (optional). `colou?r` matches "color" and "colour".

* **`[]` (Character Set):** Matches any single character *within* the brackets. `[aeiou]` matches any vowel. `[0-9]` matches any digit. `[a-zA-Z]` matches any letter (upper or lowercase).

* **`[^]` (Negated Character Set):** Matches any single character *not* within the brackets. `[^0-9]` matches any non-digit character.

* **`()` (Grouping):** Groups parts of the pattern.  Useful for applying quantifiers to groups or capturing matched substrings for later use. `(ab)+` matches "ab", "abab", "ababab".

* **`|` (Or):** Matches either the expression before or after the pipe symbol. `cat|dog` matches "cat" or "dog".

* **`\` (Backslash):**  Used for escaping metacharacters (treating them as literals) or for special sequences (see below). `\$` matches a literal dollar sign.


### 3. Quantifiers

These symbols specify how many times a part of the pattern should repeat.

* **`*` (Asterisk):** Zero or more occurrences.
* **`+` (Plus):** One or more occurrences.
* **`?` (Question Mark):** Zero or one occurrence.
* **`{n}`:** Exactly *n* occurrences.  `a{3}` matches "aaa".
* **`{n,}`:** At least *n* occurrences. `a{2,}` matches "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", etc.
* **`{n,m}`:** At least *n* and at most *m* occurrences. `a{2,4}` matches "aa", "aaa", "aaaa".


### 4. Special Sequences

These are backslash escapes that represent common character sets.

* **`\d`:** Any digit (0-9).
* **`\D`:** Any non-digit character.
* **`\w`:** Any alphanumeric character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore).
* **`\W`:** Any non-alphanumeric character.
* **`\s`:** Any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
* **`\S`:** Any non-whitespace character.
* **`\b`:** A word boundary.
* **`\A`:** The beginning of the string.
* **`\Z`:** The end of the string.


## II.  `re` Module Methods

Python's `re` module provides functions for working with regular expressions.

### 1. `re.compile(pattern, flags=0)`

Compiles a regex pattern into a reusable regex object.  Improves performance if you'll use the same pattern many times.


### 2. `re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)`

Searches the entire string for the first match of the pattern. Returns a `Match` object if found, otherwise `None`.


### 3. `re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)`

Attempts to match the pattern *only at the beginning* of the string. Returns a `Match` object if a match is found at the beginning, otherwise `None`.


### 4. `re.fullmatch(pattern, string, flags=0)`

Checks if the pattern matches the *entire* string. Returns a `Match` object if it matches the whole string, otherwise `None`.


### 5. `re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)`

Finds all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string. Returns a list of strings (the matching substrings). Returns an empty list if no matches are found.


### 6. `re.finditer(pattern, string, flags=0)`

Similar to `findall()`, but returns an iterator of `Match` objects instead of a list of strings.  Useful when you need more information about each match (e.g., its position).


## III. Match Object Methods

The methods of a `Match` object provide detailed information about a successful match.

*   **`.group()`:** Returns the entire matched substring.
*   **`.groups()`:** Returns a tuple containing all the captured groups (if any).
*   **`.groupdict()`:** Returns a dictionary containing the named captured groups (if any).
*   **`.start()`:** Returns the starting index of the match in the string.
*   **`.end()`:** Returns the ending index of the match in the string.
*   **`.span()`:** Returns a tuple containing the `(start, end)` indices of the match.


## IV.  Flags

The `re` module supports flags to modify the behavior of regex operations.  Common flags include:

*   `re.IGNORECASE`: Performs case-insensitive matching.
*   `re.MULTILINE`: Allows `^` and `$` to match the beginning and end of each line within a multiline string.
*   `re.DOTALL`: Makes the dot (`.`) metacharacter match any character, including newline.


## V. Example Code

*(Insert your well-commented code examples from 'code.py' here, properly formatted as code blocks in Markdown.  Include explanations for each example.)*


## Conclusion

Regular expressions are a powerful toolset for text processing.  By mastering the building blocks, the `re` module's functions, and the nuances of matching, you can effectively and efficiently process and manipulate text data in Python.
